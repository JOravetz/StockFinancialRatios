# StockFinancialRatios
Generate Sharpe, Sortino, Information, Treynor, Calmar, and Omega ratios for financial risk analysis.

## Purpose

Computing these financial ratios for stocks serves several purposes:

* Performance Evaluation: These ratios help investors and analysts evaluate the historical performance of a stock or a portfolio. They can provide insights into how well a stock has performed compared to a benchmark or the market in general.

* Risk Assessment: Ratios such as the Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Information Ratio, and Treynor Ratio help investors understand the risk-adjusted performance of a stock or a portfolio. By considering both returns and risk, investors can make more informed decisions about their investments.

* Portfolio Optimization: Financial ratios can be used to optimize a portfolio by selecting stocks with the desired risk-return characteristics. For example, investors might choose stocks with high Sharpe Ratios to maximize returns per unit of risk.

* Investment Strategy: By analyzing these ratios, investors can develop and refine their investment strategies. For example, they might focus on stocks with high Omega Ratios to capture more upside potential than downside risk, or use Calmar Ratios to identify investments with favorable risk-return profiles in the context of drawdowns.

* Comparison: Investors can use these financial ratios to compare different stocks or portfolios and identify the best opportunities based on their investment goals and risk tolerance.

these financial ratios help investors analyze stock performance, assess risk, optimize their portfolios, and develop effective investment strategies.
